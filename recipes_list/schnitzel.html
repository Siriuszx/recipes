    <h1>German Schnitzel (Schweineschnitzel)</h1>

        As much as I love to cook – and being from Germany – it would be unforgivably inexcusable, a total outrage, if I didn’t know how to make Schnitzel!  After all, it’s the quintessential German dish.  Every tourist to Germany has had Schnitzel and most fall in love with it.  (I suppose there are the occasional odd individuals who don’t like it, and there’s sadly just no helping them).

        Most Americans associate Schnitzel with Wienerschnitzel.  “Wienerschnitzel” is actually a geographically protected term in Germany and Austria and can only be made with veal.  This traditional German Schnitzel is prepared the same way as Austrian Wiener Schnitzel.  The only difference – German Schnitzel is made with pork (my preference) instead of veal.  As for where the Schnitzel originally came from…the technique of breading and frying thin cuts of meat is attributed to the Romans from around 1 BC.  Another little tidbit:  Austrians will be the first to admit that Wienerschnitzel doesn’t come from Wien (Vienna).

        But whether it’s Schweineschnitzel or Wienerschnitzel, when it’s perfectly breaded, perfectly fried, and perfectly crispy, practically everyone loves a good Schnitzel!  And now you can make it – perfectly – in your own kitchen!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless pork steaks or chops, (to make Austrian Wienerschnitzel use thin veal cutlets)</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour combined with 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3/4 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the pork chops between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them until just 1/4 inch thick with the flat side of a meat tenderizer. Lightly season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

        <li>
            Top with the beef stock and bay leaves. 
            Bring it up to a boil and then reduce to a simmer, and simmer covered for about 15 minutes. 
            Now add the cabbage and cook for another 15 minutes or until the vegetables are fork tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add in tomato paste, red wine vinegar, fresh dill and salt and pepper. 
            Taste and adjust the seasonings accordingly. It all is really just to taste, so add as much or as little as you want.
        </li>
        <li>
            But what should be mandatory, is to serve the soup with a dollop of sour cream, fresh dill and crusty bread. Enjoy!
