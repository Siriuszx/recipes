    <h1>German Schnitzel (Schweineschnitzel)</h1>

        As much as I love to cook – and being from Germany – it would be unforgivably inexcusable, a total outrage, if I
        didn’t know how to make Schnitzel! After all, it’s the quintessential German dish. Every tourist to Germany has
        had Schnitzel and most fall in love with it. (I suppose there are the occasional odd individuals who don’t like
        it, and there’s sadly just no helping them).

        Most Americans associate Schnitzel with Wienerschnitzel. “Wienerschnitzel” is actually a geographically
        protected term in Germany and Austria and can only be made with veal. This traditional German Schnitzel is
        prepared the same way as Austrian Wiener Schnitzel. The only difference – German Schnitzel is made with pork (my
        preference) instead of veal. As for where the Schnitzel originally came from…the technique of breading and
        frying thin cuts of meat is attributed to the Romans from around 1 BC. Another little tidbit: Austrians will be
        the first to admit that Wienerschnitzel doesn’t come from Wien (Vienna).

        But whether it’s Schweineschnitzel or Wienerschnitzel, when it’s perfectly breaded, perfectly fried, and
        perfectly crispy, practically everyone loves a good Schnitzel! And now you can make it – perfectly – in your own
        kitchen!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="recipe_list">
        <li>4 boneless pork steaks or chops, (to make Austrian Wienerschnitzel use thin veal cutlets)</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour combined with 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3/4 cup plain breadcrumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="recipe_list">
        <li>
            Place the pork chops between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them until just 1/4 inch thick with the
            flat side of a meat tenderizer. Lightly season both sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the flour mixture, egg, and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow bowls. Dip the chops in the flour, the
            egg, and the breadcrumbs, coating both sides and all edges at each stage. Be careful not to press the
            breadcrumbs into the meat. Gently shake off the excess crumbs. Don't let the schnitzel sit in the coating or
            they will not be as crispy once fried - fry immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure the cooking oil is hot enough at this point (about 330 degrees F) as you don't want the Schnitzel
            to sit around in the coating before frying. Use enough oil so that the Schnitzels "swim" in it.
        </li>
        <li>
            But what should be mandatory, is to serve the soup with a dollop of sour cream, fresh dill and crusty bread.
            Enjoy!
            Fry the Schnitzel for about 2-3 minutes on both sides until a deep golden brown. Transfer briefly to a plate
            lined with paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately with slices of fresh lemon and parsley sprigs or with your choice of sauce. Serve with
            German Spaetzle (see recipe for Homemade German Spaetzle), French fries, or German potato salad, and with a
            fresh leafy green salad.
