                The borscht is a very important soup in many Slavic countries, especially Ukraine and Russia,
                but Ukraine is usually stated as the origin of the borscht.
                The word borscht is said to be derived from the Slavic word for cow parsnip and used to be the basis of
                this
                soup.
                However, beets were more easily cultivated and eventually replaced the cow parsnip.

                It has a long history and it varies greatly from country to country,
                area to area and kitchen to kitchen, so it can be a bit confusing when you don't know what you are
                looking for.
                This recipe is for the most known version with beetroots and cabbage.

                Traditionally it was sour from a lot of other ways, but I make it super easy more suited for today's
                cooking
                styles,
                using something we should all have - red wine vinegar - to create the same sour soup effect.

            To make this soup, first we will begin with the beef.
            In a large saucepan or casserole, heat oil on medium high heat. Add cubed beef and sear until browned, a
            couple of minutes (1). Add onion and cook for another five minutes or until the onion is translucent.
            Add garlic and stir for a minute before adding in the carrots, parsnip, potato and beets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with the beef stock and bay leaves.
            Bring it up to a boil and then reduce to a simmer, and simmer covered for about 15 minutes.
            Now add the cabbage and cook for another 15 minutes or until the vegetables are fork tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add in tomato paste, red wine vinegar, fresh dill and salt and pepper.
            Taste and adjust the seasonings accordingly. It all is really just to taste, so add as much or as little as
            you want.
        </li>
        <li>
            But what should be mandatory, is to serve the soup with a dollop of sour cream, fresh dill and crusty bread.
            Enjoy!
